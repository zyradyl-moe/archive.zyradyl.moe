# Zyradyl's Blog #
This is the repository for my blog. You will find two different projects merged
here. The first is the theme that I use, which is Jekyll Clean. Jekyll Clean is
licensed under a different license than my own. You can read more about that
below, as well as the file list and what license applies to each one. For my
own work, everything is licensed under Creative Commons Zero except where
otherwise noted. If you are unsure, check the front matter in the page's
markdown file for confirmation.

Thank you for checking out my repository.

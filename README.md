# Lanyon

Lanyon is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme with a toggleable sidebar drawer for out of sight navigation. It's based on [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), the Jekyll butler.

## Installation

### Requires Poole

To get started, download [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole). See [the usage guidelines](https://github.com/poole/poole#usage) for how to install and get up and running with Jekyll and Poole.

### Enabling Lanyon

Copy over the included files to turn any vanilla Poole site into a Lanyon site.

- Replace `_includes/` with the included folder of the same name (will replace `_includes/head.html` and add `_includes/sidebar.html`)
- Replace `_layouts/default.html` with the included file of the same name
- Move `public/css/lanyon.css` to `public/css/`

Then, start up your Jekyll server and go!


## Options

Lanyon includes some customizable options, typically applied via classes on the `<body>` element.


### Sidebar menu

Create a list of nav links in the sidebar by assigning each Jekyll page the correct layout in the page's [front-matter](http://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/).

```
---
layout: page
title: About
---
```

**Why require a specific layout?** Jekyll will return *all* pages, including the `atom.xml`, and with an alphabetical sort order. To ensure the first link is *Home*, we exclude the `index.html` page from this list by specifying the `page` layout.


### Themes

Lanyon ships with eight optional themes based on the [base16 color scheme](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16). Apply a theme to change the color scheme (mostly applies to sidebar and links).

There are eight themes available at this time.

To use a theme, add any one of the available theme classes to the `<body>` element in the `default.html` layout, like so:

```html
<body class="theme-base-08">
  ...
</body>
```

To create your own theme, look to the Themes section of [included CSS file](https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/public/css/lanyon.css). Copy any existing theme (they're only a few lines of CSS), rename it, and change the provided colors.


### Reverse layout

Reverse the page orientation with a single class.

```html
<body class="layout-reverse">
  ...
</body>
```


## Development

Lanyon's main branch is `gh-pages`, which includes a full Jekyll setup to ensure a smooth workflow. **All pull requests should be to submitted against `gh-pages`.**

Lanyon also contains a `master` branch for generating distribution builds. `master` contains only the files you need to convert an existing Jekyll site, like that provided by [Poole](https://github.com/poole/poole), which Lanyon is built on top of. **No pull requests will be accepted to `master`.**

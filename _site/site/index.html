  <p>I take pride on keeping my website as minimal as possible, even if that means
the number of commits is excessive, or I spend hours comparing different
fonts in an effort to find one that is bold, but not loud.  However, as a side
effect of this, I frequently realize I don’t have any place to thank the people
who’s code or other work has contributed to helping me to host, and design,
this website. That is what this page is for. Feel free to give the awesome
people below a look to find out more about them.</p>

<p>In the event that I once used something, but I no longer do, I will still
include a link to the work that person did.</p>

<h2 id="code">Code</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Without <strong><a href="http://jekyllrb.com/" title="Jekyll’s Official Homepage">Jekyll</a></strong>, I wouldn’t have a website. <strong>Jekyll</strong> is a program
based in ruby that takes files written in Markdown and converts them into a
static site. I don’t speak any of the web languages, but I do understand
Markdown, so this nifty program means I can have a web presence.<br />
<em><strong>Jekyll</strong> is available under the <strong><a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll/blob/master/LICENSE" title="Jekyll’s Github: LICENSE File">MIT License</a>.</strong></em></li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://getpoole.com/" title="Poole’s Official Homepage">Poole</a></strong> bills itself as <em>“a dilligent and nobel steward for building
Jekyll sites.”</em> I can certainly testify to that. The designer of <strong>Poole</strong> is
also behind the theme I am currently using with this site, which is called
<strong><a href="http://lanyon.getpoole.com/" title="Lanyon’s Official Homepage">Lanyon</a></strong> and is delightfully minimalist. <strong>Poole</strong> is currently using
SASS to write its designs, which I know absolutely nothing about, but I
look forward to trying my hand at porting <strong>Lanyon</strong> over to it.<br />
<em>Both <strong><a href="https://github.com/poole/poole/blob/master/LICENSE.md" title="Poole’s Github: LICENSE File">Poole</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://github.com/poole/lanyon/blob/master/LICENSE.md" title="Lanyon’s Github: LICENSE File">Lanyon</a></strong> are available under the
<strong>MIT License.</strong></em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="fonts">Fonts</h2>
<p>Being a typist has to be frustrating. You create rather beautiful glyphs, and
release them for free under various licenses, and suddenly it is used
everywhere without so much as a hint to it being your work. This site uses
three different fonts:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong><a href="https://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/raleway" title="Raleway’s Official Homepage">Raleway</a></strong> is the font choice for what you are reading right now. It
is an elegant, sans-serif font that is minimalist at the 300 weight, but
manages to bring in quite a lot of character at the 400 weight. It was
developed by <strong><em>“The League of Movable Type”</em></strong> but that website lists
<strong><em>Matt McInerney</em></strong> as the sole contributer. I use it at 400 weight.<br />
<em><strong>Raleway</strong> is released under the <strong><a href="https://github.com/theleagueof/raleway/blob/master/Open%20Font%20License.markdown" title="Raleway’s Github: LICENSE File">SIL Open Font License</a>.</strong></em></li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.impallari.com/dosis" title="Dosis’ Official Website">Dosis</a></strong> is the font that is used for headers, pagination buttons,
as well as the navigation bar. It was designed by <strong><em>Edgar Tolentino</em></strong>,
refined by <strong><em>Pablo Impallari</em></strong>, and spaced by <strong><em>Igino Marini</em></strong>. It has a
rather refreshing level of character, and was the perfect addition to my
site to really make it pop. I use it at 400 weight, which is classified as
minimalist by the designers, but I think it has quite a strong impression.<br />
<em><strong>Dosis</strong> is released under the <strong><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL" title="SIL Open Font License: Official Site">SIL Open Font License</a></strong>.</em></li>
  <li><strong><a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html" title="Inconsolata’s Official Website">Inconsolata</a></strong> is probably one of my favourite monospaced fonts. For
deployment on this website it was between <strong>Inconsolata</strong> or <strong>Anonymous
Pro</strong> and after trying them both out, I preferred the former. It was designed
by <strong><em>Raph Levien</em></strong> and he says that it is his first serious font design.
You can view his entire collection by visiting <strong>Inconsolata’s</strong> official
website. I actually use this on my own computer in terminals and IDEs. On
this site it is used at 400 weight.<br />
<em><strong>Inconsolata</strong> is released under the <strong><a href="http://scripts.sil.org/OFL" title="SIL Open Font License: Official Site">SIL Open Font License</a></strong>.</em></li>
</ul>

<h2 id="utilities">Utilities</h2>
<p>I use a number of tools to host and maintain this website, one of which I am
rather ashamed to say I have come to like quite a lot, despite the fact that
it is as far away from minimal as anything could ever be.</p>

<ul>
  <li>To get us started, this website is proudly hosted on <strong><a href="http://github.com" title="GitHub’s Official Website">Github</a></strong>,
which is also, in my personal opinion, one of the best choices for software
hosting, period. As you can probably guess, this also means that I use
<strong><a href="http://gitscm.com" title="Git’s Official Website">git</a></strong> as my version control system of choice.</li>
  <li>While I was previously using vim to do my editing, I have since switched
over to <strong><a href="http://atom.io" title="Atom’s Official Website">Atom</a></strong>. While it is large and somewhat unwieldy, the package
management system gives me access to a more than a few utilities that I can
use to simplify my workflow.</li>
  <li>Finally, my convoluted workflow makes use of <strong><a href="http://travis-ci.org" title="Travis-CI’s Official Website">Travis-CI</a></strong> to check
over my development branch before I push it live. At first it was just an
exercise in having something I didn’t really need, but using it has actually
found quite a few things that I never would have caught on my own.</li>

# Zyradyl's Blog #
This is the repository for my blog. You will find four different projects merged
here. The first code merged into this repository was for the theme Jekyll-Clean.
After a few days I discovered Poole, and implemented that, followed by the Hyde
theme for poole. You can read more about that below, as well as the file list
and what license applies to each one. For my own work, everything is licensed
under Creative Commons Zero except where otherwise noted. If you are unsure,
check the front matter in the pageâ€™s markdown file for confirmation.

Thank you for checking out my repository.

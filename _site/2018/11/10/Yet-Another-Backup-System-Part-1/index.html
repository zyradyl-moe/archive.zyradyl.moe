  <h1 class="post-title">Yet Another Backup System - Part 1</h1>
  <span class="post-date">10 Nov 2018</span>
  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>I’ve been wanting to get back into blogging, or at least writing more
consistently, and I’ve also been looking for projects to work on. One of my
favorite things to do, oddly enough, is to work on systems that will manage
large amounts of data. So, I’ve decided to start a new project.</p>

<p>This is the first in a series of posts detailing the creation of a multi-tiered
backup system for me, some of my friends, and potentially (but not likely)
others as well. I will warn people ahead of time that I’m not building any
hardware that could be called “resilient,” instead I’m using things that I
already have around the house, plus a few extra cheap purchases, and a lot
of software to make things work.</p>

<p>Speaking of software, almost everything used will be cross-platform and open
source. I will likely be writing a lot of “glue,” in the form of shell scripts
or potentially even some ruby. I will also be trying to focus on keeping things
secure on untrusted servers, and secure in transit, to sometimes ridiculous
levels. That being said, this is <strong>NOT</strong> a zero-knowledge system. Since it is
for me, family, and friends, they are made aware of this ahead of time. In time,
it is possible that this setup will grow and evolve to make a zero-knowledge
system that functions similarly to this initial design idea, but that’s far
down the line.</p>

<p>None of these blog posts will likely be as refined as my Icinga2 tutorials. One
of the things I am trying to do is just get myself into the habit of documenting
my projects. If I keep having to revise, edit, and source, I’ll eventually give
up. So if there is anything you are interested in learning more about, Google
will likely be your best friend.</p>

<p>Essentially, these are meant to explain how I built the system, and why I did
what I did. Sometimes that may be as simple as “because I like them more” and
other times it may have to do with more in depth research.</p>

<h2 id="environment">Environment</h2>

<p>The server will exist in an environment with a battery backup system provided
for the server, any data drives, and the core router that the server will be
connected to. Connection to the internet is provided with a 100mbps symmetrical
fiber connection that can be upgraded instantly to 1Gbps symmetrical if needed.
Connections between the server and the fiber node is provided via CAT-7A
cabling. Routing is handled by a Ubiquiti EdgeRouter Lite, with 3gbps line rate
and one million packet per second routing. IPv6 and IPv4 are supported.</p>

<p>Eventually the router will be able to provide routes both to the public internet
and to the dn42 darknet and Tor services.</p>

<h2 id="hardware">Hardware</h2>

<p>The hardware isn’t exactly great, but it is the best that can be done at this
time. The server consists of a Mac Mini Model 2,1 made circa early 2007. It
contains a dual core Intel Core2 Duo processor running at 2.0 GHz.

<p>The server has been modified substansially from it’s factory state. The sound
card has been removed, as has the WiFi card and Bluetooth card. IR functionality
has been disconnected. Any extraneous wires have been removed. The original
160GB Hitachi hard drive has been replaced with a 240GB solid state drive from
OWC. The ram has been maxed out with 4GBs, again provided from OWC. The system
is not capable of addressing all 4GB despite being a 64-bit system due to
limitations imposed in the EFI. The CMOS battery was replaced, and the processor
was unseated, cleaned, and thermal material replaced. The fan was also replaced
to head off any potential issues caused by old age. You can see a picture of the
internals of the system below.</p>

<p><img src="/images/posts/mac-mini.jpeg" alt="Modified MacMini2,1" /></p>

<p>The system is connected to the router with a Fluke-Certified CAT-7A S/FTP dual
shielded cable. The interface it is connected to supports a 1Gbps full-duplex
connection.</p>

<p>The primary data disk is a G-Disk USB-C 4TB external drive. This drive utilizes
a white label Western Digital Red WD40EFRX. It is connected to the Mac Mini via
an Anker PowerLine+ USB-C to USB-A nylon cable.</p>

<p>The older Mac Mini’s would refuse to boot if the system could not detect that a
monitor was connected to the system. Apple claims that this is because the Mac
Mini was intended to be a true personal computer, which would generally prohibit
the system’s operation without a display device. Strangely, no such detection is
present to test for either a keyboard or a mouse.</p>

<p>To bypass this issue, a DVI Dummy Plug is installed in the Mini’s DVI port. This
plug uses EDID to tell the system that a 1920x1200 capable display is connected.
This has also been reported to be useful in accelerating VNC Remote
Administration, however no GUI is present on the system.</p>

<h2 id="operating-system">Operating System</h2>

<p>The operating system used on the server is OpenSUSE Leap 15 x64. You may
remember that I mentioned above that the EFI used on the system is 32-bits.
This limitation is bypassed by formatting the internal server drive to utilize
a legacy MBR partition table. From this, GRUB2 loads in legacy mode, which is
32-bits. This provides the shim that allows the 32-bit system firmware to load
a 64-bit operating system. Over 72 hours of stress testing revealed no
instability with the operating system booted via this method.</p>

<p>OpenSUSE was installed using the Server profile. Originally the
Transactional-Server profile was used, however the early morning reboots
could cause issues, and the installation did not seem to play well with LVM.</p>

<h2 id="hardware-stress-testing">Hardware Stress Testing</h2>

<p>The internal solid state drive was tested via an OpenSUSE Live distribution. The
computer was first suspended and resumed to bypass the system’s EFI’s proclivity
for freezing the internal drive’s security interface. Once the interface was
unlocked, <code class="highlighter-rouge">smartctl</code> was used to trigger the drives internal SMART short test,
conveyance test, and extended test, in that order. All results were nominal.
The internal drive was then wiped via <code class="highlighter-rouge">hdparm</code> by sending an ATA Enhanced Secure
Erase Command with a non-null password.</p>

<p>A quick installation of OpenSUSE Leap 15 was then performed.</p>

<p>The hardware was then tested from inside the new installation utilizing the
Stress-NG test suite for over 24 hours. During this time, four virtual memory
test workers iterated over 100% of the available memory to force swapping as
well as check for ram errors. Two CPU test workers were ran on the aggressive
settings, and an IO worker was deployed to check the SSD interface. All systems
passed the stress test perfectly, with benchmarks appropriate for a system from
2007.</p>

<p>The external drive was then connected to the system. A battery of tests were
performed. First, the drive was tested via <code class="highlighter-rouge">smartctl</code>. As the drive is connected
via USB, the <code class="highlighter-rouge">-d sat,16</code> option was passed to allow communication directly with
the USB-SATA bridge. The drive was tested out of the box using the SMART short
self test, conveyance test, and extended self test. This first round of testing
took 10 hours to execute. After the inital round of tests, the SMART attributes
table and its corresponding values was recorded.</p>

<p>Then the <code class="highlighter-rouge">badblocks</code> command was ran to write to and read from every sector on
the drive. The full command was
<code class="highlighter-rouge">badblocks -wsv -t random -b 4096 -c 4096 -p 4 -o /root/sdb.log /dev/sdb</code>. This
performed four read-write-verify passes. Each pass took approximately 50 hours
to complete.</p>

<p>Once the <code class="highlighter-rouge">badblocks</code> battery was complete, <code class="highlighter-rouge">smartctl</code> was once again used to
run the same testing sequence of short, conveyance, and extended self tests. The
attribute table was once again dumped, it’s values recorded, and the values then
compared to those from the table dumped prior to running <code class="highlighter-rouge">badblocks</code>.</p>

<p>As these tests are actually still in progress, the results are not yet
definitive.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>This first post simply outlines the primary variables in this project. Hardware,
operating system, and environment should all be assumed to remain static for
the remaining project entries. Should anything change, I will likely update this
entry versus notating it in the respective entry where the change was made. It
will be made clear that this entry has been edited, should that come to pass.</p>

<p>Extensive testing was performed to detect any chance of infant-mortality in the
hardware. I have previously had negative experiences utilizing hardware right
out of the box.</p>

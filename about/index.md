## Blurb ##
Hi my name is Natalie and I’m a 26 year old Pharmacy student based out of
Michigan. When I’m not reading up on the latest and greatest pharmaceuticals
I like to take things apart. Anything. A car, a computer, dumping compiled
code into object code to see how it works. Running network scans on my ISP
to try and figure out why PMTUD on IPv6 is broken and I have to manually set
an MTU of 1280 on my router… If you can think of something, I’ve probably
done it.

Right now I am especially interested in embedded systems and networking, which
is why it makes up so much of my content current, however, this may change at
a moments notice. I like embedded systems because they still require an
extreme amount of efficiency.

As for the style of computer user I am, I believe it can be summed up by a
small list of view points:

 * My favourite processor is [SPARC][1]. This is followed by [MIPS][2],
   [AVR32][3], [ARM][4], and last and certainly least, [x86 and x64][5]. The
   last x86 processor I actually liked was when [Cyrix][6]
   [reverse engineered][7] [Intel’s Pentium][8] via [clean room engineering][9]
   and produced a faster processor, which Intel
   [then stole and made into the Pentium Pro.][10]
 * I think [microkernels][11] are the golden standard of what should be
   implemented in an operating system design.
 * [Modular kernels][12] are the worst thing to ever happen to security. (I
   will be nice and not go into the fragmentation penalty.)
 * [Dynamic linking][13] is
   [one of the worst things to ever happen to programming][14].
   ([Library Symbol Versioning Hell][15])
 * [SystemD][16] is the worst thing to ever happen to [Linux][17], and that’s
   [saying something][18]. (GNU is Not Usable)
 * In a past life, I was a developer for a source based linux distribution
   where I spent literally all of my time attempting to make linux packages
   build for [Clang/LLVM][19] and yelling at upstream for using GNU specific
   extensions.
 * [DragonFlyBSD][20] is the most exciting operating system of today.
 * [NetBSD][21] should be the standard of Embedded System Development.
 * [GPL][22] is just as bad, if not worse, than standard copyright.
 * [GPLv3][23] is the [single][24] [most][25] [terrifying][26] [thing][27]
   to ever happen to GNU, and that is [REALLY saying something][28].
 * “There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it
   so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to
   make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies.” ~ C.A.R.
   Hoare.
      - I believe [Object Oriented Code][29] is the latter. (OOPs..)
 * It is highly likely that the days of good code are over, because when
   given the choice between easy and terrible ([Java][30], [Python][31],
   [Ruby][32]) versus hard but stable ([LISP][33],[C][34],[Go][35]) the entire
   [computer science][36] world has embraced the first.
 * I don’t believe that just because you have a 1TB Hard Drive that you can
   justify or allow a 16+ Gigabyte operating system.
 * I don’t believe just because you have CPU cycles you should waste them
   on abstraction compared to low level clean code.
 * I don’t believe that any program other than those handling data sets of
   over 512MB should EVER use 1GB or more of RAM.
 * [SQL Databases][37] are so horrible that the designer will get into heaven
   simply because the devil doesn’t have time to deal with that shit.
 * [Git][38] is the only sane version control software.

 **Last, but certainly not least:**

 * Just because everyone uses a software, a software is easy, you are mandated
   to use a software, or the software/protocol is old **does not mean
   you should live in a delusional world about how bad it is.** ([*I’m looking
   at you,*][40] [*SSH*][39].)

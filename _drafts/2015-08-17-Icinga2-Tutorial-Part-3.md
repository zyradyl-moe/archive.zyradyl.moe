For this part of the tutorial, we are actually going to be rewriting the host
file for localhost. Unfortunately, I thought the EdgeOS would be capable of
running an Icinga2 client, but it isnâ€™t available through the apt-repositories,
and after the ntopng incident of July and August, I am not stressing that
processor any more than it needs to be to run my network. (It is stressed
enough as it is, but that is a post for another day.)

Since I have done most of the explaining in the files, these tutorials will
start including links to the configuration files, and any external resources
I have used.

You can find the configuration file for the agent checks here.

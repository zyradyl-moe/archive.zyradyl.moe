### Introduction ###
This section will be divided into several parts. In the first part, we will talk
about the environment that the server exists in. This will handle things like
power and networking, basically everything that exists outside the server. Next,
we will take a look at the server itself, and any changes that have been made to
it. We will then discuss the currently used storage devices. Finally, we will
talk about things that could be improved with this setup, and any potential
changes that could be made to increase security.

title: Introducing Did
---

[Did](http://mdo.github.io/did) is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme, designed and built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It's based on another theme, [Hyde](http://andhyde.com). The name originates from a rather well-known, and unsurprisingly relevant, psychiatric condition.

> Dissociative identity disorder (<strong>DID</strong>), also known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is an extremely rare mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately control a person's behavior.

Did is designed to showcase your content first and foremost. Navigation and extraneous information remains offscreen until the reader requests it. Did is built mobile first, meaning it looks and behaves great on devices from phones to desktops. It ships with everything you need to start a new Jekyll project. Feel free to snag whatever you need to shoehorn Did into an existing Jekyll site, too.

### Features

* Complete Jekyll setup included (layouts, config, 404, RSS feed, posts, and page)
* Mobile friendly design and development
* Easily scalable text and component sizing with `rem` units in the CSS
* Sliding sidebar (built with only CSS)
* Sidebar includes support for textual modules and a basic navigation
* Two orientations for content and sidebar, default (left sidebar) and reverse (right sidebar)
* Support for a wide gamut of HTML elements
* Related posts (time-based, because Jekyll) below each post
* Syntax highlighting, courtesy Pygments (the Python-based code snippet highlighter)

### Browser support

Did is by perference a forward-thinking project. In addition to the latest versions of Chrome, Safari (mobile and desktop), and Firefox, it is only compatible with Internet Explorer 9 and above.

### Download

Did is developed on and hosted with GitHub. Head to the <a href="https://github.com/mdo/did">GitHub repository</a> for downloads, bug reports, and features requests.

Thanks!

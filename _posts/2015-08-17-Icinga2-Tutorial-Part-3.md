For this part of the tutorial, we are actually going to be rewriting the host
file for localhost. Unfortunately, I thought the EdgeRouter would be
capable of running an [Icinga2][5] client, but it isnâ€™t available through the
apt repositories, and after the ntopng incident of July and August, I am
not stressing that processor any more than it needs to be to run my network.
(It is stressed enough as it is, but that is a post for another day.)

Since I have done most of the explaining in the files, these tutorials will
start including links to the configuration files, and any external resources
I have used.

[You can find the configuration file for the agent checks here.][6]

**Import Notes**
It is worth noting that this article was intended to be a quick write up to
get something online. In time, I may come back to rewrite things, but at the
very least I hope the comments in the pastebin file are helpful.

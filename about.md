  Hey there! This page is included in Did as an example. Feel free to customize it for your own use upon downloading. Carry on!
</p>

[Did](http://mdo.github.io/did) is a [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) theme, designed and built by [@mdo](https://twitter.com/mdo). It started off as an optional layout for another theme, [Hyde](http://andhyde.com). The code for both layouts added too much overhead, so a new theme was created.

## Name

The name *Did* originates from a rather well-known, and unsurprisingly relevant, psychiatric condition.

> Dissociative identity disorder (<strong>DID</strong>), also known as multiple personality disorder (MPD), is an extremely rare mental disorder characterized by at least two distinct and relatively enduring identities or dissociated personality states that alternately control a person's behavior.

If it wasn't obvious by now, the reference is the novel, *The Strange Case of Dr. Jeykll and Mr. Hyde*. Jekyll is the platform, Hyde the sister (and original) theme, and now Did the split personality theme (sidebar and content). Is it a stretch? Probably, but I love it.

## Setup

Some fun facts about the setup of this project include:

* Built for [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com)
* Developed on GitHub and hosted for free on [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com)
* Fonts PT Sans (headings) and PT Serif (body), and are served by [Google Web Fonts](http://www.google.com/webfonts)
* Coded with [Sublime Text 2](http://sublimetext.org), an amazing code editor
* Designed and developed while listening to music like [Blood Bros Trilogy](https://soundcloud.com/maddecent/sets/blood-bros-series)

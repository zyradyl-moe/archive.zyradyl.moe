## Blurb ##
Hi my name is Natalie and I'm a 26 year old Pharmacy student based out of
Michigan. When I'm not reading up on the latest and greatest pharmaceuticals
I like to take things apart. Anything. A car, a computer, dumping compiled
code into object code to see how it works. Running network scans on my ISP
to try and figure out why PMTUD on IPv6 is broken and I have to manually set
an MTU of 1280 on my router... If you can think of something, I've probably
done it.

Right now I am especially interested in embedded systems and networking, which
is why it makes up so much of my content current, however, this may change at
a moments notice. I like embedded systems because they still require an
extreme amount of efficiency.

As for the style of computer user I am, I believe it can be summed up by a
small list of view points:

 * My favourite processor is SPARC. This is followed by MIPS, AVR32, ARM, and
   last and certainly least, x86 and x64. The last x86 processor I actually
   liked was when Cyrix reverse engineered Intel's Pentium via clean room
   engineering and produced a faster processor, which Intel then stole and
   made into the Pentium Pro.
 * I think microkernels are the golden standard of should be implemented in an
   operating system design.
 * Modular kernels are the worst thing to ever happen to security.
 * Dynamic linking is one of the worst things to ever happen to programming.
   (Library Symbol Versioning Hell)
 * SystemD is the worst thing to ever happen to Linux, and that's saying
   something.
 * In a past life, I was a developer for a source based linux distribution
   where I spent literally all of my time attempting to make linux packages
   build for Clang/LLVM and yelling at upstream for using GNU specific
   extensions.
 * DragonFlyBSD is the most exciting operating system of today.
 * NetBSD should be the standard of Embedded System Development.
 * GPL is just as bad, if not worse, than standard copyright.
 * GPLv3 is the single most terrifying thing to ever happen to GNU, and that
   is REALLY saying something.
 * "There are two ways of constructing a software design: One way is to make it
   so simple that there are obviously no deficiencies and the other way is to
   make it so complicated that there are no obvious deficiencies." ~ C.A.R.
   Hoare.
      - I believe Object Oriented Code is the latter.
 * It is highly likely that the days of good code are over, because when
   given the choice between easy and terrible (Java, Python, Ruby) versus
   hard but stable (LISP,C,Go) the entire computer science world has
   embraced the first.
 * I don't believe that just because you have a 1TB Hard Drive that you can
   justify or allow a 16+ Gigabyte operating system.
 * I don't believe just because you have CPU cycles you should waste them
   on abstraction compared to low level clean code.
 * I don't believe that any program other than those handling data sets of
   over 512MB should EVER use 1GB or more of RAM.
 * SQL Databases are so horrible that the designer will get into heaven
   simply because the devil doesn't have time to deal with that shit.
 * Git is the only sane version control software.

 **Last, but certainly not least:**

 * Just because everyone uses a software, a software is easy, you are mandated
   to use a software, or the software/protocol is old **does not mean
   you should live in a delusional world about how bad it is.** (*I'm looking
   at you, SSH.*)
